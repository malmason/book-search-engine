## 📝 Description

```
The Book Search Engine app allows you to search for books usin the Google
API.

You can create a login and save a link and description of books you like to

This is a functioning application that used a RESTful backend for it's API
searching. It has been modified to use GraphQL as an alternative to the 
RESTful API routes.
